# Recycle Bin Manager: Manage Your Recycle Bin From Anywhere
Recycle Bin Manager is an easy-to-use app that lets you conveniently open and empty the Windows Recycle Bin. 

## Download
**Download the latest release [here](TODO)**.

Recycle Bin Manager is available both as an MSI installer and a portable app.

## Features
- Empty the Recycle Bin in one click, optionally hiding the confirmation dialog
- Open the Recycle Bin folder directly within the app
- Show/hide confirmation dialog setting is persisted between sessions
- Small, lightweight, and native app written in C with the Win32 API 

## Building
You will need:
- A development environment set up for building Win32 applications (I use Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition)
- The [HeatWave](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FireGiant.FireGiantHeatWaveDev17) Visual Studio extension (only if you wish to build the MSI installer)

## Acknowledgements
This app would never have come to fruition without the constant support, encouragement, and ingenuity of the [Handmade community](https://handmade.network/).
